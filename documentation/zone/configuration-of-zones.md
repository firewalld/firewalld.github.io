title: "Configuration of Zones"
--- 

To configure or add zones you can either use one of the firewalld interfaces to handle and change the configuration. These are the graphical configuration tool firewall-config, the command line tool firewall-cmd or the D-BUS interface. Or you can create or copy a zone file in one of the configuration directories. `/usr/lib/firewalld/zones` is used for default and fallback configurations and `/etc/firewalld/zones` is used for user created and customized configuration files.
