### Predefined services

A service is a combination of port and/or protocol entries. Optionally netfilter helper modules can be added and also a IPv4 and IPv6 destination address.

### Ports, source ports and protocols

Definition of tcp or udp ports, where ports can be a single port or a port range.

### ICMP blocks

Selected Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) messages. These messages are either information requests or created as a reply to information requests or in error conditions.

### Masquerading

The addresses of a private network are mapped to and hidden behind a public IP address. This is a form of address translation.

### Forward ports

A port is either mapped to another port and/or to another host.
